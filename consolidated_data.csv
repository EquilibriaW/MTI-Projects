The company gradually grew from 3,000 to 8,000 square feet as my father invested in the kind of modern equipment that was being used in European shops. I grew up with the company, gradually taking on more and more responsibility until my parents retired in the late 1990‚Äôs.,WE‚ÄôRE COMMITTED,Today, with a staff of 13, we remain committed to quality craftsmanship. We continue to build our cabinets on site, using leading-edge computerized equipment that allows us to use complex processes to build our cabinets more accurately and more efficiently than ever before.,WE‚ÄôRE CUSTOM,We create finished cabinets that deliver the design, space and look that fulfill your vision which means that every cabinet we build is unique, based on your desires, taste and vision.

Made in the USA.,Johnson Bros. began when Edwin Johnson, Sr. decided to go into business himself. In 1947, he started constructing the company's first roll forming machine (now in storage) in his basement. He had offered his five brothers and equal share of the business if they matched is life savings, a $700 investment. One brother, Harold Johnson, did; hence the name Johnson Bros.

He had a vision of a new method for making custom, built-in cabinets. At the time, the standard way to produce kitchen cabinets was to have a finishing carpenter build the cabinets on-site. Cabinets were built directly onto the wall, essentially becoming permanently affixed to the structure of the building. The quality and style of the cabinets was dependant on the abilities of the builder's finishing carpenter.,Clarence's bold new concept was to build the cabinets in a shop and transport them for installation. Though this seems to be basic common sense nowadays, at the time it seemed revolutionary.,This method has become the universal standard for custom cabinetmaking. It immediately resulted in a general improvement in quality. Options were added, starting with the pull-out bread board, then the Lazy Susan. Now, the options available are almost limitless.,Clarence adapted the skills learned from working in his father's furniture shop in Holland to producing custom, built-in cabinets. Now retired, he has handed the family business to his sons, who have always 'lived and breathed' cabinets. Nu-Way Kitchens continues to operate as a family business, providing a completely custom cabinet experience in a way that a family run enterprise is so well suited for.,Now, all these many years later, you could say that the new way has become a tradition.,Nu-Way Kitchens ‚Äì Quality.
